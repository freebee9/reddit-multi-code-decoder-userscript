[github.com/freebee9/reddit-multi-code-decoder-userscript](https://github.com/freebee9/reddit-multi-code-decoder-userscript)

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Format Detection**: Automatically scans Reddit comments for multiple encoding types
  - **Binary Code**: Sequences of 0s and 1s (e.g., `01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`)
  - **NATO Phonetic**: Alphabet sequences (e.g., `Alpha Bravo Charlie`)
- **Real-time Translation**: Converts encoded messages to readable text instantly
- **Smart Combining**: NATO sequences in same text are combined into single translation
- **Centralized Search**: Configurable search provider system (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- **Text Selection Search**: Select any text in comments and get a popup to search it (dismiss by clicking elsewhere)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both new Reddit and old Reddit
- **Dynamic Loading**: Handles lazy-loaded comments and expansions
- **Performance Optimized**: Unified processing with minimal impact on browsing experience

## üìã Requirements

- Browser with userscript support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Userscript manager extension:
  - **Violentmonkey** (recommended)
  - Tampermonkey
  - Greasemonkey

## üîß Installation

1. **Install a userscript manager**:
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (recommended)
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

2. **Install the script**:
   - Copy the userscript code
   - Open your userscript manager
   - Click "Create new script" or "+" button
   - Paste the code and save

3. **Enable the script**:
   - Make sure the script is enabled in your userscript manager
   - Visit any Reddit page to start using it

## üìñ How It Works

### Multi-Format Pattern Detection
The script looks for various encoding patterns:

**Binary Code:**
```
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
```

**NATO Phonetic Alphabet:**
```
Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta Echo
Lima India Mike Alpha
```

### Translation Process
1. **Unified Scanning**: Single pass detects all encoding types in comments
2. **Format-Specific Conversion**: 
   - Binary: Converts 8-bit groups to ASCII characters
   - NATO: Maps phonetic words to letters (Alpha‚ÜíA, Bravo‚ÜíB, etc.)
3. **Smart Validation**: Only shows translations for valid, meaningful text
4. **Combined Results**: NATO sequences in same text are joined into single translation

### Examples

**Binary code:**
```
Input:  01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
Output: üî¢ Binary: "Hello" [üîç Search]
```

**NATO phonetic:**
```
Input:  Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta Echo
Output: üìª NATO: "ABCDE" [üîç Search]
```

## üéØ Usage

1. **Browse Reddit normally** - the script works automatically
2. **Look for translation boxes** - they appear below comments containing encoded content
   - üî¢ Blue boxes for binary translations
   - üìª Blue boxes for NATO phonetic translations
3. **Click the search button** - instantly search the translated text using your configured provider
4. **Select text for search** - highlight any text in comments to get a search popup (click anywhere to dismiss)
5. **Expand comments** - the script will scan newly loaded content for all encoding types

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Supported Reddit Layouts
- New Reddit (reddit.com)
- Old Reddit (old.reddit.com)
- Mobile Reddit layouts

### Encoding Format Requirements

**Binary Code:**
- Must be valid 8-bit binary (multiples of 8 characters)
- Should decode to printable ASCII characters (32-126)
- Minimum 2 consecutive 8-bit sequences required

**NATO Phonetic:**
- Must contain at least 2 valid NATO phonetic words
- Supports variations: Alpha/Alfa, Xray/X-ray
- Flexible separators: spaces, commas, periods, hyphens
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multiple sequences in same text are combined

### Performance Features
- **Efficient scanning**: Uses TreeWalker for optimal DOM traversal
- **Duplicate prevention**: Marks processed elements to avoid re-scanning
- **Lazy loading support**: Monitors for dynamically added content
- **Event-driven updates**: Responds to comment expansions
- **Text selection detection**: Lightweight event handling for text selection

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Search Provider Configuration
The script includes a centralized search system supporting multiple providers:

```javascript
// Switch to different provider
SEARCH_CONFIG.active.provider = "bing";  // or "duckduckgo"

// Change default search type
SEARCH_CONFIG.active.defaultSearchType = "webSearch";  // or "imageSearch"

// Add custom provider
SEARCH_CONFIG.providers.custom = {
    name: "Custom Search",
    webSearch: "https://example.com/search?q={{QUERY}}",
    imageSearch: "https://example.com/images?q={{QUERY}}"
};
```

### Detection Pattern Modification

**Binary patterns:**
```javascript
const binaryPattern = /(?:\b[01]{8}\b[\s]*){2,}/g;
```

**NATO patterns:**
```javascript
const natoPattern = new RegExp(/* dynamically generated from NATO_ALPHABET */);
```

### Styling Customization
All decoders use unified styling for consistency:
```javascript
container.style.cssText = `
    margin: 8px 0;
    padding: 12px;
    background: #f8f9fa;  // Unified theme
    border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
    // Only icons and labels differ between decoder types
`;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### False Positive Considerations

**Binary Decoder:**
- **Current threshold**: Minimum 2 consecutive 8-bit sequences (16 bits = 2 characters)
- **Potential issue**: Short random binary-looking patterns may trigger false positives
- **Example**: `01000001 01000010` would decode to "AB" and show a translation
- **Mitigation**: Script validates that decoded text contains only printable ASCII characters
- **Future improvement**: Consider increasing minimum threshold to 3-4 sequences for better accuracy

**NATO Phonetic Decoder:**
- **Current threshold**: Minimum 2 valid NATO phonetic words
- **False positive risk**: Low - well-calibrated threshold
- **Example**: Single word "India" (country name) won't trigger, but "Alpha Bravo" will
- **Validation**: Only recognizes official NATO phonetic alphabet words

### Detection Accuracy

**Binary Detection:**
- Very short meaningful text (1-2 characters) might be dismissed as potential false positives
- Complex binary with mixed content may not be detected if interspersed with non-binary text
- Only detects space-separated or clearly bounded 8-bit sequences

**NATO Detection:**
- Requires exact spelling of NATO phonetic words (case-insensitive)
- Mixed languages or non-standard phonetic alphabets won't be detected
- Sequences with too many non-NATO words between phonetic words may be missed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Script Not Working
- Ensure your userscript manager is enabled
- Check that the script is active in the extension
- Refresh the Reddit page
- Check browser console for errors

### No Translations Appearing
**Binary Issues:**
- Verify the binary code is in valid 8-bit format
- Ensure the binary translates to readable ASCII text
- Some binary sequences might be filtered out if they contain non-printable characters
- Very short sequences (1-2 characters) may be filtered to prevent false positives

**NATO Issues:**
- Need at least 2 valid NATO phonetic words
- Check spelling of phonetic words (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.)
- Multiple sequences in same comment are automatically combined
- Mixed or non-standard phonetic alphabets won't be recognized

### Text Selection Popup Not Appearing
- Make sure you're selecting text within comment areas
- Try selecting longer text (minimum 3 characters)
- Check if other extensions are interfering with text selection

### Performance Issues
- The script is optimized for performance
- If experiencing slowdowns, try disabling other Reddit extensions temporarily
